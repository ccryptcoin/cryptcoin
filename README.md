# Crypt befallen by bad actors, will recover!

## Apologies for unethical behavior
**First let me say that I had *no* idea any of this was happening. I'm releasing this info to benefit all current and potential investors. I do not want to go down with Crypt.**

- There was a hidden block written in with more than the total coin volume. This is block 38400. The developer released this info to me while trying to 
reel me into his scheme.
- There were some bribes going on behind the scenes with the btc-e.com exchange. A small portion of one of the bribes in action between a btc-e mod and admin can be seen [here](http://pastebin.com/Q76VrYdp)
- We have additional info on our bitcointalk thread. This may be seen [here](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=618377.0) on bitcointalk.

**Mindfox has left development because of these discoveries. Anon development has therefore been suspended indefinitely**

I hope the community can move past these bad actors and this doesn't mean the end for the coin!
